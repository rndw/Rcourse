Learning how to program for the first time can be an extremely challenging activity and there really is no quick and dirty way to go from zero to hero. As with any skill, it requires practice and commitment. With this in mind, in order to solidify your new knowledge into a tangible skill, it needs to do something for you. In short, work on a project which you can relate to; no matter how insignificant or mundane you might think it is.

The best way to learn any programming language is to try, try again and ultimately fail in order to learn from your mistakes. However, you can make the journey less intimidating by keeping a few rules at hand. Think of it as a way to approach a problem from a programming perspective. Programming rules are in many cases universal, meaning that once you have a good grasp on how to approach problems, you can choose which programming language to use.

Most important is to use what you're comfortable with. There are many solutions to the same problem. *Keep in mind that if you're working in a group/project, others may need to use your code. Keep to the group/project template as far as possible.*

This course is meant to get you off the ground as a new user to R. There are many pitfalls to using R on a regular basis and it would be difficult to cover all of them. Thus the focus on giving you the tools which will allow you to teach yourself.

Lets get started!
